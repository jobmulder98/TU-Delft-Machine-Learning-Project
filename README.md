# TODO
In this assigment I had to treat a problem as a supervised classification task. The training input (observations) and output (action labels) 
data will be obtained through demonstrations of humans manually controlling the robot car. By training your machine learning models on these 
demonstrations, you will create an AI which "imitates" how a human would drive. This type of supervised machine learning is therefore called 
imitation learning. There are some coding challenges and design choices that you have to solve to use human driving demonstrations as labeled 
data to create your machine learning models. As before, you will have to think about feature extraction, hyperparemeter optimization, evaluation 
metrics, comparing models, etc. Once you have trained a classification model, you could define a new policy function which uses your trained 
model, and test this policy in the simulator. Does your most succesful model also accumulate the most reward in the simulation? Can you make an 
AI which succesfully drives on known and unknown planets.
